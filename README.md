# Priority Pass & Taxi Integration

An application integration that allows airport travellers to coordinate lounge access with taxi bookings through intelligent journey timeline management.

## Architecture Overview

### System Design Philosophy

This integration approach follows Domain-Driven Design principles with a microservices-oriented approach, designed to scale from a simple integration proof-of-concept to a full multi-modal travel platform.

### Key Technical Choices & Rationale

#### 1. Anti-Corruption Layer Pattern

**Choice**: Implemented dedicated ACL components for external integrations (Flight, Taxi, Lounge APIs)  
**Rationale**:
- Protects core business logic from external API changes
- Enables independent evolution of domain models
- Provides consistent data transformation and validation

#### 2. Shared Services Architecture

**Choice**: Extracted timing calculations and data integration into shared services  
**Rationale**:
- Enables both Priority Pass and Taxi apps to leverage same business logic
- Supports future expansion to other travel modes (rideshare, public transit)
- Reduces duplication and ensures consistency in journey calculations
- Allows independent app deployment cycles

#### 3. Cross-App Deep Linking Strategy

**Choice**: Maintained separate mobile applications with deep-link integration  
**Rationale**:
- Preserves existing brand identities and user bases
- Faster MVP delivery (no UI consolidation required)
- Allows A/B testing of integrated vs. separate experiences
- Lower technical risk than full app merger

#### 4. Journey-Centric Domain Model

**Choice**: Created Journey domain as primary coordination entity  
**Rationale**:
- Encapsulates complex timing logic and business rules
- Provides single source of truth for multi-modal travel plans
- Supports future features like alternative route suggestions
- Natural boundary for transaction management

## Technology Stack Decisions

**Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- Rapid development, excellent ecosystem for API integrations
- JavaScript consistency across mobile and backend teams

**Web/Mobile**: React (TypeScript)  
- Faster iteration cycles for UI experimentation
- Strong TypeScript integration for API contract safety

**Database**: PostgreSQL  
- ACID compliance for booking transactions
- JSON support for flexible integration data storage
- Strong ecosystem and operational tooling

**Integration Protocol**: REST over HTTPS  
- Universal compatibility with external APIs
- Simple debugging and monitoring
- Can be expanded with GraphQL for performance optimization

## Omissions & Trade-offs

### Deliberately Excluded from MVP Scope

#### Authentication & Authorization

**Omitted**: Detailed auth flows, user management, cross-app SSO  
**Rationale**:
- Standard OAuth2/JWT patterns assumed
- Focus architecture effort on unique integration challenges

#### Payment Processing Integration

**Omitted**: Payment flows, refund handling, split billing  
**Rationale**:
- Complex regulatory and PCI compliance requirements
- Not core to proving integration value proposition
- Existing payment systems in both apps can be leveraged initially

#### Real-Time Notifications

**Omitted**: WebSocket connections, push notification infrastructure  
**Rationale**:
- Existing notifications systems in both apps can be leveraged initially
- Real-time updates required for Journey delays due to flight delays etc. will add complexity

#### Comprehensive Error Handling

**Omitted**: Detailed retry logic, circuit breakers, graceful degradation  
**Rationale**:
- Focus on happy path for MVP
- Standard error handling patterns, APM can be leveraged from existing implementations

#### Caching Strategy

**Omitted**: Redis layer, API response caching, offline capability  
**Rationale**:
- Adds operational complexity vs limited performance gains in the MVP stage
- Can be expanded to have offline capabilities by caching responses

## Architectural Shortcuts Taken

### Simplified Data Consistency Model

**Shortcut**: Basic REST transactions without distributed transaction management  
**Risk**: Potential for booking conflicts or orphaned reservations  
**Solution**: Implement saga pattern or event sourcing for complex multi-service transactions


### Generic Integration API

**Shortcut**: Single integration service handling all external API types  
**Risk**: Performance bottlenecks, difficult to optimize per-provider  
**Solution**: Split into provider-specific services with dedicated connection pools

### Manual Timing Calculations

**Shortcut**: Simple algorithmic timing  
**Risk**: Poor recommendations during rush hour or delays - users miss flights or waste time  
**Solution**: Integrate real-time traffic APIs for accurate ETAs


## Use of AI Tools

AI tools were used to accelerate design, and documentation, particularly during the early architecture and prototyping phases.

### ChatGPT

Used as a technical assistant for:
- Generating initial C4 diagram boilerplate in PlantUML
- Drafting the structure of this README to ensure clarity and coverage
- Speeding up documentation formatting and refining technical language

**Assessment**: ChatGPT significantly reduced the time spent on scaffolding architecture documents and validating design trade-offs.

### Human Judgment

While AI tools accelerated early ideation, human decision-making was essential in areas where real-world constraints mattered 

 **Architecture Simplification**: ChatGPT initially proposed a microservices approach with event sourcing. I deliberately reduced the complexity and implemented shared services and modular boundaries instead.
